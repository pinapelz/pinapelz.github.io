I've seen a lot of these "making gil without crafting" or "making gil with combat job" guides during my time with the game.
A lot of these videos and guides are fine, but in my opinion they neglect a lot of the late game and niche options that are available to players.

This post will attempt to be a somewhat comprehensive guide/info sheet to making gil without having to level any crafting jobs (cause I get it, crafting is not for everyone).

Keep in mind though that crafters are probably one of the most consistent methods of getting gil. There will be a lot more "instability" with these methods.

I'll try and order these methods from my least to most favorite methods and leave a bit of a quick conclusion at the end.

# Blue Mage Vault Runs
This method essentially involves running <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/a62f7ee3718/" class="eorzeadb_link">The Vault</a>
level synced as a Blue Mage for raw gil (gil doesn't dropped running unsynced).

Since each trash enemy before the first boss drops around 300 gil each and are very tightly packed together, you can burn them down fairly quickly using BLU.

Essentially you'll clear all the trash up until the first boss, then leave the duty and requeue. Each run will take around **3 minutes**

</div>

You can expect to make around 5.5k to 6k gil per run. As there are 19 enemies per run.

This is a consistent method since its farming raw gil, but requires a levelled Blue Mage with some pre-requisite spells.

I'd reccomend looking up a video guide on how to do this since there is a bit of technique involved in how to minimize the time
per run and what spells to bring.

- **Overall:** Its not the most terrible thing since to earn 100K an hour, but it'll be an excrusiatingly boring hour of pure grind.
Not bad if you need like 10-20K gil in a pinch though.

# Regular Instanced Dungeons

</div>

In terms of regular dungeons, there isn't much that's worth farming. The only thing worth mentioning at all is farming for certain dungeon exclusive housing items.

However, not all of them are worth farming since the drop rates between them vary. This means that there's really only a select few that still hold up on the marketboard.

To find these you'll have to go down the [list of housing items](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Housing_Items), see which ones are dungeon exclusive, and then check the marketboard

If a recent dungeon has been released, try looking at the drop table to see if a housing item is available as well.

Two items that I find are still fairly decent are the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/700d0588b97/" class="eorzeadb_link">Verdant Partition</a> from 
<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/25cf070eeb4/" class="eorzeadb_link">Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)</a>
 and <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/8936ce152be/" class="eorzeadb_link">Alzadaal's Garden Lamp</a> from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/d56ff366a07/" class="eorzeadb_link">Alzadaal's Legacy</a>

| A fair amount of gil if you can sell them | But drops are not guaranteed each run |
|----------|----------|

- **Overall:** The drops are worth gil but rates aren't great. Options are also limited and sales don't happen very fast. A little more worth it
if you also turn in the dungeon gear for Grand Company Seals.but still not the best option.

## Deep Dungeons

Deep Dungeons are also a bit of a mixed bag. You can certainly make money by doing them but the speed is not very fast (especially if you're farming solo).
All 3 of the currently available dungeons have some sort of exclusive glamour, minions, barding, mounts, etc. that you can get.

Keep in mind to farm the higher floors (100+ for palace of the dead and 30+ for Heaven on High or Eureka Orthos), you'll need to enter as a
pre-made party. You could theoretically go in solo but you'll likely die unless you've taken the time to farm out your Deep Dungeon gear.

If you do have a party, then I'd say that you should just go in for fun and try to reach the highest floor. Explore all the rooms and reap the rewards
along the way

If you're solo farming, then its best in my opinion to just repeatedly farm floors 1-10 of each dungeon. You can get these done even without
queueing for a party and the rewards are still decent.

In that case you'll be looking for some variant of the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/cf49da29c51/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bronze-trimmed Sack</a> from whichever
deep dungeon you decide to take on. For example even the oldest deep dungeon, Palace of the Dead's bronze sacks still have high valued gear:

**Beware though! This is a case of double RNG. You'll need to first pray for the sack to drop and then pray you don't get a terrible item from that sack**

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={10393} itemName="Thavnairian Bustier" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/42441.png" />

- **Overall:** Because of the low drop sack rates, and the fact that you'll need to grind out your Deep Dungeon gear a bit to make this faster;
I tend to avoid this method. I find the rate of finding the sacks themselves too low to be worth it.

### Criterion
This is a bit of an add-on to variant dungeons. For those who've never seen it, it basically takes the bosses from all routes of the dungeon and mashes them together
into what you'd exepct from a traditional instanced dungeon. 

You'll also have to go in as a standard light party (2 DPS, 1 Tank, 1 Healer). Enemies hit harder and the bosses have more difficult mechanics. Because of this
players on North America use the Party Finder to find groups to run this content.

You'll earn 4 of whatever currency the criterion dungeon uses which can be used to exchange for various items again. 

You'll really only have 2 options here since the materia is already outclasses by the 7.0 ones. So its either the mount for 100 (you can get it as a rare drop too!) 
or the orchestrion roll for 8.

Both will be worth a fair amount of gil on the marketboard with the orchstrion roll being `2-3 million` and the mount being `10+ million`

![Rokkon Mount and Orchestrion](https://files.catbox.moe/vgbgsr.png)

> WARNING! If you clear and unlock the Savage variant, you do not get same the currency for clearing Savage!
>
> You get some other currency that is used to exchange for a few untradeable furnishings or accessories. NOT WORTH in my opinion.

- **Overall:** To be honest, this will be difficult to find a group to do solo since past criterions are generally dead content on the party finder.
It also takes a bit of time to learn the mechanics, but if you do get a group and run it every now and then its very decent gil even for just the orchestrion roll.

# Grand Company Seals
You can rack up Grand Company seals (or GC Seals) fairly quickly by completing "Expert Deliveries". This is where you can
cash in on useless old gear or dungeon drops. You can usually get around `2000` seals per piece of "high level dungeon" gear.

Then you can spend these seals on certain items that are needed for crafting. In my opinion, most of these items net fairly low gil
but some commonly exchanged items are...
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/58886c8cb88/" class="eorzeadb_link">Glamour Prism</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/e7b966f42a9/" class="eorzeadb_link">Coke</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b97f3ff6b34/" class="eorzeadb_link">Potash</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/2ff3e7e028c/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cordial</a>


|As an example of how much these materials go for... | Not very much at all but there's always a market for it |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5530} itemName="Coke" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5501} itemName="Potash" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/027000/027612_hr1.png" /> |

You can also try your luck by exchaning `20 000` seals for either a 3.0 or 4.0 `Materiel Coffer`. These drop random minions and
mounts from that particular expansion.

Don't get your hopes up so quick though. A very vast majority of the minions are basically worthless on the marketboard.
The actual rare mounts and minions have some serious Japanese gacha game drop rates...

Let's take the Night Pegasus Whistle as an example:
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={16564} itemName="Night Pegasus Whistle" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/026000/026039_hr1.png"/>
> Based on the drop rate collected by the FFXIV Dalamud Plugin [Tracky](https://github.com/Infiziert90/TrackyTrack). 
> ### [This item has a drop rate of roughly 0.03%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VfncSL5gf9E7ehgND5nZgguUyUAmZiAMbQllLKcoxTQ/edit?gid=1530436115#gid=1530436115)

The same story is true for all of the other rare mounts/minions. If you were to test your luck though I'd go for the 4.0 coffers since it beats
the 3.0 coffers in number of rare items which will give you a slight statistical edge.

- **Overall:** Slow gil but very easy, and a great way to get some value out of old gear.
Don't bother specifically farming dungeons specifically for gear to turn in since the gil comes very slow

## Variant Dungeons

</div>
A relatively new method introduced in Endwalker so you'll need to be level 90, completed the main story, and unlocked Variant dungeons. These are perfect for farming
since they are meant to be completed with 1-4 players of any role.

Each variant dungeon has a set of exclusive glamours that you can exchange with currency earned from that dungeon.

Using Mount Rokkon as an example, each run is around 25 minutes solo (assuming you don't die) and will net you around 3 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c64f6172340/" class="eorzeadb_link">Rokkon Potsherds</a>
| Exchange for 18 Shards | Exchange for 9 Shards |

> TIP: If you decide to run this and have all routes already completed, I'd recommend always taking the path that the NPC picks for you at the start
of the duty. 
>
>This will give you 1 extra chest that drops some exclusive minions/furniture/items **(no additional currency)**. The items you get from these do
vary though, some are worth a lot and some are worth next to nothing.

- **Overall:** Excellent method to farm a ton of gil if you're willing to put in the time. Pick up the pace and bring a few friends and you can 
make quite a bit in a fair amount of time. So long as the glamours are still worth something on the marketboard of course.
