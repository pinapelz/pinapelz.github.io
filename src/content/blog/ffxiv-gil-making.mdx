I've seen a lot of these "making gil without crafting" or "making gil with combat job" guides during my time with the game.
A lot of these videos and guides are fine, but in my opinion they neglect a lot of the late game and niche options that are available to players.

This post will attempt to be a somewhat comprehensive guide/info sheet to making gil without having to level any crafting jobs (cause I get it, crafting is not for everyone).

Keep in mind though that crafters are probably one of the most consistent methods of getting gil. There will be a lot more "instability + RNG" with these methods.

I'll try and order these methods from my least to most favorite methods and leave a bit of a quick conclusion at the end.

# Blue Mage Vault Runs
This method essentially involves running <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/a62f7ee3718/" class="eorzeadb_link">The Vault</a>
level synced as a Blue Mage for raw gil (gil doesn't dropped running unsynced).

Since each trash enemy before the first boss drops around 300 gil each and are very tightly packed together, you can burn them down fairly quickly using BLU.

Essentially you'll clear all the trash up until the first boss, then leave the duty and requeue. Each run will take around **3 minutes**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://files.catbox.moe/zjaerj.png" />
  <p>Map of Route to Take in The Vault Dungeon</p>
</div>

You can expect to make around 5.5k to 6k gil per run. As there are 19 enemies per run.

This is a consistent method since its farming raw gil, but requires a levelled Blue Mage with some pre-requisite spells.

I'd recommend looking up a video guide on how to do this since there is a bit of technique involved in how to minimize the time
per run and what spells to bring.

- **Overall:** Its not the most terrible thing since to earn 100K an hour, but it'll be an excrusiatingly boring hour of pure grind.
Not bad if you need like 10-20K gil in a pinch though.

# Regular Instanced Dungeons
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://files.catbox.moe/vvt3j3.05" />
  <p>Lodestone Image of Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)</p>
</div>

In terms of regular dungeons, there isn't much that's worth farming. The only thing worth mentioning at all is farming for certain dungeon exclusive housing items.

However, not all of them are worth farming since the drop rates between them vary. This means that there's really only a select few that still hold up on the marketboard.

To find these you'll have to go down the [list of housing items](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Housing_Items), see which ones are dungeon exclusive, and then check the marketboard

If a recent dungeon has been released, try looking at the drop table to see if a housing item is available as well.

Two items that I find are still fairly decent are the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/700d0588b97/" class="eorzeadb_link">Verdant Partition</a> from 
<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/25cf070eeb4/" class="eorzeadb_link">Saint Mocianne's Arboretum (Hard)</a>
 and <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/8936ce152be/" class="eorzeadb_link">Alzadaal's Garden Lamp</a> from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/duty/d56ff366a07/" class="eorzeadb_link">Alzadaal's Legacy</a>.

| A fair amount of gil if you can sell them | But drops are not guaranteed each run |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={23892} itemName="Verdant Partition" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/52649.png" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={41140} itemName="Alzadaal's Garden Lamp" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/t/52395.png" /> |

- **Overall:** The drops are worth gil but rates aren't great. Options are also limited and sales don't happen very fast. A little more worth it
if you also turn in the dungeon gear for Grand Company Seals, but still not the best option.

## Deep Dungeons
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://files.catbox.moe/t9cqlq.jpg" />
  <p>Image of Heaven on High</p>
</div>
Deep Dungeons are also a bit of a mixed bag. You can certainly make money by doing them but the speed is not very fast (especially if you're farming solo).
All 3 of the currently available dungeons have some sort of exclusive glamour, minions, barding, mounts, etc. that you can get.

Keep in mind to farm the higher floors (100+ for Palace of the Dead and 30+ for Heaven on High or Eureka Orthos), you'll need to enter as a
pre-made party. You could theoretically go in solo, but you'll likely die unless you've taken the time to farm out your Deep Dungeon gear.

If you do have a party, then I'd say that you should just go in for fun and try to reach the highest floor. Explore all the rooms and reap the rewards
along the way.

If you're solo farming, then it's best in my opinion to just repeatedly farm floors 1-10 of each dungeon. You can get these done even without
queueing for a party and the rewards are still decent.

In that case, you'll be looking for some variant of the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/cf49da29c51/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bronze-trimmed Sack</a> from whichever
deep dungeon you decide to take on. For example even the oldest deep dungeon, Palace of the Dead's bronze sacks still have high valued gear:

**Beware though! This is a case of double RNG. You'll need to first pray for the sack to drop and then pray you don't get a terrible item from that sack.**

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={10393} itemName="Thavnairian Bustier" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/42441.png" />

- **Overall:** Because of the low drop sack rates, and the fact that you'll need to grind out your Deep Dungeon gear a bit to make this faster;
I tend to avoid this method. I find the rate of finding the sacks themselves too low to be worth it.

---

# Grand Company Seals
You can rack up Grand Company seals (or GC Seals) fairly quickly by completing "Expert Deliveries". This is where you can
cash in on useless old gear or dungeon drops. You can usually get around `2000` seals per piece of "high level dungeon" gear.

Then you can spend these seals on certain items that are needed for crafting. In my opinion, most of these items net fairly low gil
but some commonly exchanged items are...
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/58886c8cb88/" class="eorzeadb_link">Glamour Prism</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/e7b966f42a9/" class="eorzeadb_link">Coke</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b97f3ff6b34/" class="eorzeadb_link">Potash</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/2ff3e7e028c/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cordial</a>


|As an example of how much these materials go for... | Not very much at all but there's always a market for it |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5530} itemName="Coke" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={5501} itemName="Potash" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/027000/027612_hr1.png" /> |

You can also try your luck by exchaning `20 000` seals for either a 3.0 or 4.0 `Materiel Coffer`. These drop random minions and
mounts from that particular expansion.

Don't get your hopes up so quick though. A very vast majority of the minions are basically worthless on the marketboard.
The actual rare mounts and minions have some serious Japanese gacha game drop rates...

Let's take the Night Pegasus Whistle as an example:
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={16564} itemName="Night Pegasus Whistle" itemImageUrl="https://xivapi.com/i/026000/026039_hr1.png"/>
<br/>
> Based on the drop rate collected by the FFXIV Dalamud Plugin [Tracky](https://github.com/Infiziert90/TrackyTrack). 
> ### [This item has a drop rate of roughly 0.03%](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VfncSL5gf9E7ehgND5nZgguUyUAmZiAMbQllLKcoxTQ/edit?gid=1530436115#gid=1530436115)

The same story is true for all of the other rare mounts/minions. If you were to test your luck though I'd go for the 4.0 coffers since it beats
the 3.0 coffers in number of rare items which will give you a slight statistical edge.

- **Overall:** Slow gil but very easy, and a great way to get some value out of old gear.
Don't bother farming dungeons specifically for gear to turn in since the gil comes very slow.

# FATEs + Bicolor Gemstones

Completing FATEs in Shadowbringers (5.0+) or later zones will reward you with Bicolor Gemstones. 

These can be exchanged for various materials used by crafters. Usually the materials of the most recently released expansion are worth the most gil.

Selling these materials will usually yield a good amount of gil, but the price usually depreciates over time.

However, if you have have maxed out your Shared FATE rank in an expansion, then you can do a more lucrative method:

![](https://i.postimg.cc/fTjdRw1j/Shared-fates.jpg)

The Shared FATEs ranking screen can be accessed by Travel -> Shared FATEs in your quick menu.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/66ZRFV0P/450px-Shared-FATESHB.png)

To max out your Shared FATE rank in a particular expansion:
- Shadowbringers: Achieve Rank 3 in all zones (60 FATEs in each zone)
- Endwalker: Achieve Rank 3 in all zones (60 FATEs in each zone)
- Dawntrail: Achieve Rank 4 in all zones (40 FATEs in each zone)

Once you've maxed out your rank, you can exchange your Bicolor Gemstones for one of the vouchers below (more may be added in future expansions):

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={43961} itemName="Turali Bicolor Gemstone Voucher" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/26183.png"/>
<br/>
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={35833} itemName="Bicolor Gemstone Voucher" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/25906.png"/>

These vouchers can be exchanged for 100 bicolor gemstones each. You can sell the vouchers directly or save up 500 and exchange them for an extremely rare mount/accessory:
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/f5f3dea70c2/" class="eorzeadb_link">Ty'aitya Whistle</a> (Tural Vouchers)
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/076ae30dedd/" class="eorzeadb_link">Fallen Angel Wings</a>
- <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/65ba947f858/" class="eorzeadb_link">Wivre Horn</a>

These are probably some of the most expensive marketboard items in game...

|  |  |
|---|---|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={36340} itemName="Fallen Angel Wings" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/58017.png"/> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={43590} itemName="Ty'aitya Whistle" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/26039.png"/> |


> TIPS: I find that FATEs levelled synced down to the highest level of the FATE usually take around 4 mins to complete on DPS solo. Its about 30-50% slower on Tank/Healer solo.
>
> Bring out your Chocobo to help you out! Also try to join a party or use the party finder to form a FATE farming group
>
> Always kill The Forlorn/Forlorn Maidens if they spawn in your FATE. These grant you the `Twist of FATE` effect which can grant you increased rewards, including Bicolor Gemstones!

- **Overall:** Its a bit mind numbing but its great gil if you love doing FATEs. I suggest using it as an opportunity to level up jobs. Maximize your time
by doing FATEs while in queue for other content.

# Variant Dungeons
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://files.catbox.moe/4ppr8k.png" />
  <p>Image of Mount Rokkon</p>
</div>
A relatively new method introduced in Endwalker so you'll need to be level 90, have completed the main story, and unlocked Variant dungeons. These are perfect for farming
since they are meant to be completed with 1-4 players of any role.

Each variant dungeon has a set of exclusive glamours that you can exchange with currency earned from that dungeon.

Using Mount Rokkon as an example, each run is around 25 minutes solo (assuming you don't die) and will net you around 3 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c64f6172340/" class="eorzeadb_link">Rokkon Potsherds</a>
| Exchange for 18 Shards | Exchange for 9 Shards |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={40442} itemName="Shishu Bujin Hitatare" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/42961.png" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={40443} itemName="Shishu Bujin Kiribakama" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/t/47991.png" /> |

> TIP: If you decide to run this and have all routes already completed, I'd recommend always taking the path that the NPC picks for you at the start
of the duty. 
>
>This will give you 1 extra chest that drops some exclusive minions/furniture/items **(no additional currency)**. The items you get from these do
vary though, some are worth a lot and some are worth next to nothing.

- **Overall:** Excellent method to farm a ton of gil if you're willing to put in the time. Pick up the pace and bring a few friends and you can 
make quite a bit in a fair amount of time. So long as the glamours are still worth something on the marketboard of course.

### Criterion
This is a bit of an add-on to variant dungeons. For those who've never seen it, it basically takes the bosses from all routes of the dungeon and mashes them together into what you'd expect from a traditional instanced dungeon. 

You'll also have to go in as a standard light party (2 DPS, 1 Tank, 1 Healer). Enemies hit harder and the bosses have more difficult mechanics. Because of this
players on North America use the Party Finder to find groups to run this content.

You'll earn 4 of whatever currency the criterion dungeon uses which can be used to exchange for various items again. 

You'll really only have 2 options here since the materia is already outclasses by the 7.0 ones. So it's either the mount for 100 (you can get it as a rare drop too!) 
or the orchestrion roll for 8.

Both will be worth a fair amount of gil on the marketboard with the orchstrion roll being `2-3 million` and the mount being `10+ million`.

![Rokkon Mount and Orchestrion](https://files.catbox.moe/vgbgsr.png)

> WARNING! If you clear and unlock the Savage variant, you do not get same the currency for clearing Savage!
>
> You get some other currency that is used to exchange for a few untradeable furnishings or accessories. NOT WORTH in my opinion.

- **Overall:** To be honest, this will be difficult to find a group to do solo since past criterions are generally dead content on the party finder.
It also takes a bit of time to learn the mechanics, but if you do get a group and run it every now and then, it's very decent gil even for just the orchestrion roll.

# Bozja
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://i.postimg.cc/Pr7fJj6F/FFXIV-Bozja-mem2.png" />
  <p>Bozja's capital city as it appears in Cid Garlond's memories</p>
</div>

The methods below all involve Bozja. There are certain job recommendations for each method. Some parts require you to have access to Zadnor so its
best to have completed the Bozja story.

## The Southern Front
The Southern Front is significantly better for gil making than Zadnor because doing basically anything will give you <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/f4f1e9aa16f/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Coins</a>.

- Skirmishes give 1 coin (after finishing Castrum Lacus Litore)
- Critical Engagements give 2 coins (after finishing Castrum Lacus Litore)
- Personal Spoils in Castrum Lacus Litore give 10 each chest. 50 coins at the final boss

You can then exchange these coins with the Resistance Supplier NPC in Bozjan Southern Front for various generic `Bozjan Runner's Secrets` gears. 

These can be sold on the marketboard for quite a bit of gil, and are bought by those looking to augment their Bozjan gear (which give buffs in Bozja areas).

- Head Gear: 500 Coins
- Body Gear: 999 Coins
- Hand Gear: 500 Coins
- Leg Gear: 999 Coins
- Foot Gear: 500 Coins

| Exchange for 999 Coins | Exchange for 500 Coins |
|----------|----------|
| <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={31353} itemName="Bozjan Runner's Secrets (Body Gear)" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/26108.png" /> | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={31354} itemName="Bozjan Runner's Secrets (Hand Gear)" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/26108.png" /> |


- **Overall:** Its not exactly worth it to run around the Southern Front all day and farm coins unless you're hunting for achievements/motorbike mount.
I'd say just run Castrum Lacus Litore and get the coins from there. See the next section for more info on that.

## Bozja Weekly Quests
These are weekly quests you pick up in Gangos. They require you to reach certain Resistance Ranks in Bozja before you can pick them up.

### Castrum Lacus Litore + Dalriada Weekly
<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/3dda554554e/" class="eorzeadb_link">A Ruined Opportunity</a> is a weekly quest that requires you to clear Castrum Lacus Litore (from Bozjan Southern Front) and Dalriada (from Zadnor).

As a completion reward you receive some Mettle as well as 9 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/735a2101b7b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Platinum Coins</a>

With 30 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/735a2101b7b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Platinum Coins</a> and 5 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/243947ef7c9/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Gold Coins</a>.
you can exchange them for <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/73da7e0210c/" class="eorzeadb_link">Modern Aesthetics - Early to Rise</a>.

You'll get a good amount of <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/f4f1e9aa16f/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Coins</a> which you can exchange for the Runner's Secrets Gear (explained above).

In addition to that running Dalriada gives you <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b4d47c86272/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Mythril Coins</a> which can be converted to  <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/735a2101b7b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Platinum Coins</a> at a 100:1 ratio

> NOTE: It can be difficult to run these when its not peak hours. Most of the time you will not get the full 48 people to run with.
>
> Both of these do scale to the number of players doing them, so its not impossible to clear with less than 48 people.
>
> I've seen people clear Dalriada with as little as 8 people, so as long as you have a good group you should be fine!


### Delubrum Reginae Weekly
<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/95da8246433/" class="eorzeadb_link">One Man's Relic</a> is a weekly quest that requires you to clear Delubrum Reginae.

As a completion reward you receive some Mettle as well as 3 <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/243947ef7c9/" class="eorzeadb_link">Bozjan Gold Coins</a>.

> NOTE: If you played during Shadowbringers, you might remember queueing into Deluburm Reginae by speaking to Sjeros in Gangos.
>
> Sadly this is not possible anymore since its dead content. You'll be waiting 10 minutes for a forced queue pop and then enter alone
>
> Use the party finder instead, you'll usually be going in as a group of 8 so make sure to bring essences
> Parties will wait 10 minutes for a forced queue pop and then clear alone.

- **Overall:** A nice weekly task to do. You have a chance at getting certain Bozja mounts too! The only difficulty here are forming groups to run the damn things (mentioned in Notes above).

## Cluster Farming
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://imgur.com/hiOZZld" />
  <p>Cluster Farming Map from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/jbs16u/guide_to_easy_bozjan_cluster_farming/"></a>Reddit</p>
</div>

Cluster farming is a group activity where players in Bozja Southern Front party up and burn down Tier 3 enemies for clusters.

These clusters can be exchanged for various items, but the most valuable no doubt is the Construct 14 mount.

Since this method just involves killing enemies, I won't go into much details on how to do it. This guide on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/jbs16u/guide_to_easy_bozjan_cluster_farming/) does a good job at explaining it.

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={30102} itemName="Construct 14 Identification Key" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/26014.png"/>

Exchange for 180 Clusters!

- **Overall:** A great way to make gil if you can find a group to do it with. The Construct 14 mount is worth good gil on the marketboard.

## Lost Reflecting Sprites
In Bozja zones you can kill sprites to obtain certain `Forgotten Fragments`. Different sprites spawn under different weather conditions.

Like the other enemies in Bozja zones, they don't have levels but rather have a symbol denoting their strength (I, II ,III, IV, V). The higher the level
of the sprite the more fragments it will drop.

Since we want to maximize our yield during a weather window, we'll want to kill the highest strength sprite that drops the most valuable fragments.

> TIP: It's not the different type of sprites that drop different fragments, but rather what zone they spawn in.
>
> For example: Lightning, Water, and Wind (all) sprites in Zone 3 in Bozja Southern Front drop Support fragments, but they each have different levels of strength.
> We want to prioritize the highest strength sprite in that zone since it will drop the most fragments.

**Best Sprites For Bozjan Southern Front**

| Weather | Sprite | Zone | Fragment |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Dust Storm | V Earth Sprite | 2 | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={30888} itemName="Forgotten Fragment of Care" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/20043.png" /> |

**Best Sprites For Zadnor**
| Weather | Sprite | Zone | Fragment |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Snow | V Ice Sprite | 3 | <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/f0eef0aa6e8/" class="eorzeadb_link">Forgotten Fragment of Support</a> |
| Rain | V Water Sprite | 2 | <FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={33773} itemName="Forgotten Fragment of Artistry" itemImageUrl="https://universalis-ffxiv.github.io/universalis-assets/icon2x/33773.png" /> |

> TIP: If you're in a party, you can split up and have each person kill a different sprite. This will maximize the amount of fragments you get during a weather window.
> 
> You will all each receive the same amount of fragments regardless of who kills the sprite, so long as you're in the same party.

**How to Reflect:**
1. Switch to a Tank job and take off all your gear 
2. Use a [Essence of the Irregular](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Essence_of_the_Irregular) (get it from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/13f3af60e07/" class="eorzeadb_link">Forgotten Fragment of Awakening</a> )
3. Have the [Lost Reflect](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Lost_Reflect) action ready (get it from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/f0eef0aa6e8/" class="eorzeadb_link">Forgotten Fragment of Support</a>)
4. (Optional) Put on Lost Swift for faster movement
5. Stand far away from the sprites and use Lost Reflect (it will aggro and kill you before you gain the Reflect buff)
6. Stand near the sprites and use Lost Reflect, they should now all aggro onto you
7. Refresh Lost Reflect at roughly 2-3 seconds remaining

If this confuses you, you can watch [a demo of it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCsrxOrCN4A).

- **Overall:** The amount of gil you get will be dependent on how many people need the fragments. These are commonly used in Deluburm Reginae Savage.
Still, it's a very predictable way to rake in some gil since you can always check the weather in advance using a weather tracker online.

## (Honourable Mention) Deathing ★ Mobs
Something you can do during downtime in Bozja or Zadnor is try and death a ★ mob. It's pretty annoying to do and doesn't yield a ton of fragments, but might be worth doing after you're done with Sprites.

The method essentially involves casting Death on the mobs with a "★" strength difficulty. It takes quite a few attempts since
the Lost Death spell's chances of working go up the lower the enemy's HP (unless you can somehow survive the wrath of a ★ enemy, you'll be deathing them when they're max health).

1. Switch to a Healer or a Caster with Sleep
2. Use Lost Death on the mob
3. If it fails, run out of range
4. Repeat until Lost Death works.

There are roughly 3 ★ enemies per zone in both Bozjan Southern Front and Zadnor. Each one has a 30 minute respawn time after they are killed.
If they're missing from their usual spot then someone has probably already killed them.

[This map](https://eorzeaworld.com/en/bozja) does a decent job at showing where the ★ enemies are located.

# Eureka
The methods below all involve Eureka. If you're still new to Eureka then I'd recommend maxing out your elemental level (level 60) before doing these methods
(although this is just a recommendation and some still can be done without maxing).

Notorious Monsters (NM) are essentially FATEs that spawn in Eureka zones. It's important to note that these generally have a 120 minute
cooldown per instance they are killed in, meaning they cannot spawn again until then (with the exception of Bunnies which will be touched upon later).

NMs have a random chance of spawning when killing enemies of a specific type, some also require the weather to match a certain condition.

Ask around in Eureka zones for a link to the tracker to see what's available and what's coming up, and join "prep groups" to see if you can
help spawn the NM.

## Eureka Magicite Material
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://i.postimg.cc/Yq0gzHF7/brgeef.png" />
  <p>Image of Eureka Pyros</p>
</div>

*The following method requires you to have reached Eureka Pyros or Eureka Hydatos*

Eureka features a unique mechanic known as the "Magia Board". This is where you slot in "Magicite" to give yourself certain elemental
buffs while in Eureka zones.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://i.postimg.cc/FFZ8Jjyq/Magia-Board-Normal.jpg" />
  <p>Magia Board. Numeber of magicites shown in the middle</p>
</div>

To get the last 2 magicites for the board, you'll need to get rare materials from the last 2 Eureka zones, Pyros and Hydatos.

**These have a chance of dropping when completing the NMs/FATEs listed below with full credit (Gold rating).**

*For the 6th magicite the following materials are needed:*
| Material | FATE Name | Spawn Condition |
|----------|---------|----------|
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/cd2b0a12a0e/" class="eorzeadb_link">Lamebrix's Dice</a> |  Thirty Whacks | Killing Illuminati Escapees |
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/1ec4feb4b56/" class="eorzeadb_link">Ying-Yang's Tissue</a> | Haunter of the Dark | Killing Pyros Hecteyes |
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/3ec3ca5926f/" class="eorzeadb_link">Skoll's Claw</a> | Heaven's Warg | Blizzard Weather and Killing Pyros Shuck  |

 > TIP 1: On some datacenters, Skoll and Ying-Yang are typically spawned and killed in succession.
 >
 > TIP 2: Since skoll requires the weather to be Blizzards, this means that you will generally know in advanced when Skoll is spawnable using a weather tracker
 > given that its not on cool down. It will usually spawn as soon as the weather turns over, as players have already "prepped" it in advance.
 >
 > Because its predictable when Skoll will spawn, it will usually be instapulled so arrive early!

*For the 7th magicite the following materials are needed:*
| Material | FATE Name | Spawn Condition |
|----------|---------|----------|
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/41572d0bd61/" class="eorzeadb_link">Molech's Horn</a> | Bullheaded Berserker  | Killing Val Nullchu |
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0308312bc14/" class="eorzeadb_link">Goldemar's Horn</a> | Duty-free  | Killing Hydatos Wraith (Night) |
| <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c3edbb11573/" class="eorzeadb_link">Ceto's Claw</a> |  	Stone-cold Killer  | Hydatos Delphyne  |

Unlike the 6th magicite, these are pretty much ready to go whenever so long as they aren't on cool down. Players will spawn, prep, and kill these as soon as they're available.

**Keep in mind that the drop rates on these are low! These are rare materials.**

These materials are always worth a pretty penny on the marketboard for the Eureka addicts who want Eureka best in slot.
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={24287} itemName="Skoll's Claw" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/22303.png" />
<br/>
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={24818} itemName="Goldemar's Horn" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/22204.png" />

- **Overall:** While Skoll and Ying-Yang can be planned for, the other NMs are generally killed as soon as they spawn so you'll sort of have to just pop
in and out to see if they're up (or better yet if the window is open help spawn). Generally a pretty quick RNG method since kills are fast and you can potentially get a MAX WIN (drop).

## Eureka Pagos: Cassie and Crab
*The following method requires you to be Elemental Level 35.*

Eureka Pagos offers 2 NMs that drop rare gear that can be sold on the marketboard. These items provide players in Eureka with additional stat bonuses, but
don't serve much purpose otherwise.

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={22973} itemName="Cassie Earring" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/55423.png" />

Copycat Cassie is spawned by killing "Ametrats", but can only spawn when the weather is "Blizzards".

- It usually doesn't spawn immedeately after the weather changes to Blizzards, so you'll probably have to help spawn it. Thankfully the mobs are right next to the arena.

- The earrings only drop with full credit completion (Gold rating) so join a party!

- Cassie will be instantly pulled so make sure you're in the area when it spawns.

<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={36121} itemName="Blitzing" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/54483.png" />

King Artho is spawned by killing "Val Snipper", but can only spawn when the weather is "Fog".

- Usually will spawn as soon as the weather changes to Fog, so make sure to arrive early.

- The earrings only drop with full credit completion (Gold rating) and it dies extremely quickly so join a party beforehand

- This item is **UNIQUE**, if you already have one then make sure you place it in your Saddlebag before entering Eureka: Pagos
otherwise you'll miss out on the ring if you happen to get it

![Don't be like this](https://i.postimg.cc/jSSTk7Ck/f4px9e.png)

[Don't be like this guy on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/xu3s76/psa_dont_use_blitzring_while_farming_pagos/)

- **Overall:** A very predictable way of having a chance to make big gil. Set an alarm for when the weather changes to match the
conditions and hop into Eureka.

# Eureka Bunnies
*Minimum Elemental Level 20 required. But its best to be Elemental Level 35+.*

Eureka Bunnies are a special type of NM that don't require any weather condition or prep to spawn. They also only have around a 8-15 minute cooldown
meaning that they are highly repeatable.

Completing a Bunny NM will give you the `Down the Rabbit Hole` buff for 15 minutes and also gives you a `Happy Bunny` which
follows you around.

![Happy Bunny](https://i.postimg.cc/C5VJwsm7/Eureka-pagos-happy-bunnies1.png)

The goal is to follow the Happy Bunny to a hidden chest that has spawned somewhere in the zone (this is initially invisible to the player).

To help you find the chest, you will get a `Lucky Carrot` as a key item (easily accessible from the side panel). Use this item and the Happy Bunny
will give you a hint as to the general direction of where the chest is.

![Lucky Carrot](https://i.postimg.cc/02nZqmmG/lucky-carrot-bunny-fate.jpg)

You have to be within close proximity of the chest, and then use the `Lucky Carrot` to be able to see the chest.

**Each chest will award some amount of raw gil, some 4.0 era materia (V and VI), some logograms, and possibly a "rare" item.**
We're primarily after the logograms and rare items here, the gil is a nice bonus on top of all that.

When you find a chest, it has the chance to be 1 of 3 types:
- Bronze Chest: 10 000 Gil 
- Silver Chest: 25 000 Gil
- Gold Chest: 100 000 Gil

As you can probably guess, the rarity of the chest goes Bronze, Silver, Gold. There are some speculations on what the exact rates are, but I'll say that
Gold chests are noticeably rarer than Bronze or Silver.

I'll go into a detail about each zone and what you're mainly looking for, it's recommended that you are max elemental level in the respective
zone before attempting to farm these:

## Pagos Bunnies
- There's a Northern and Southern Bunny FATE in Pagos. Don't bother doing Northern Bunnies since the locations the Bunny brings you to are extremely dangerous
even at max elemental level and hard to get to (i.e Louhi's Cave). It's better to wait for the Southern Bunny to re-spawn

| Coffer | Notable Items |
|----------|----------|
| Bronze | Nothing, but at least you still get 10K gil  |
| Silver | Nothing, but at least you still get 25K gil |
| Gold |  <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/278693f87ee/" class="eorzeadb_link">Copycat Bulb Minion</a>, Hakutaku Eyes |

There's 5 types of eyes, 4 of which you get from doing Bunnies. The prices vary but usually the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/d6fe6f9f86b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Burning Hakutaku Eye</a> are worth the most.

## Pyros Bunnies
- Same as Pagos, there's a Northern and Southern Bunny FATE in Pyros. Always go for the Southern Bunny and wait for it to re-spawn
- This is also where Logograms start to drop, people running Baldesion Aresenal will be looking to buy these

| Coffer | Notable Items |

## Hydatos Bunnies
- There's only 1 Bunny FATE in Hydatos, so you'll have to wait for it to re-spawn

- Even at max elemental level, the enemies in this Bunny FATE are pretty tough so be careful

- Bronze coffers are actually good since they can drop <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/ec9ce7dd1c2/" class="eorzeadb_link">Protective Logograms</a>

- **Overall:** Excellent method. You make some amount of consistent gil and have a chance at some very valuable items. Its also always available to do and highly repeatable!

# Hunts
The following methods below require you to have ideally unlocked hunts in the latest expansion and be at the current level cap.

Hunts are world bosses that spawn in overworld zones. They are seperated into ranks:
- B Rank: Respawns in about 5 seconds after being killed (2 per zone, with the exception of A Realm Reborn zones (1))
- A Rank: ARR zones respawn in 3.5-4.5 hours, all others respawn in 4-6 hours (2 per zone, with the exception of A Realm Reborn zones (1))
- S Rank: Respawns in a minimum of 2 days, and requires certain spawn condition to be met (1 per zone)

>B Ranks are generally can be and are done alone as part of your Hunt Mark Bills. The rest will require a larger group of people to be killed!

There are 3 types of Hunt currencies:
- Allied Seals: Earned from ARR Hunts
- Centurio Seals: Earned from Heavensward and Stormblood Hunts
- Sacks of Nuts: Earned from Shadowbringers, Endwalker, and Dawntrail Hunts

You can trade these in for a variety of things such as materia, aetheryte tickets, gear, mounts, etc.

>Note: I won't be going into detail about these currencies, think of them as the cherry on top of all the other rewards.
>
> However, if you're unsure of what to spend currency on. I usually get Ventures and Aetheryte Tickets with Allied and Centurio Seals.
> For Nuts, I will spend that on either gear to turn Grand Company Seals or buy the latest materia


I'll only be briefly introducing it, and skimming over the details. If you want to learn more about hunts then check out [The Modern Guide to FFXIV Hunts](https://ffxivhunt.carrd.co).

## Hunt Trains
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <img style={{ maxHeight: '250px' }} src="https://i.postimg.cc/SRwvn1cz/image43.jpg" />
  <p>Image of a Hunt Train from <a href="https://ffxivhunt.carrd.co/">The Modern Guide to FFXIV Hunts</a></p>
</div>

Hunt Trains are player organized events where groups of players will go around the world killing all the available A-Ranks in a particular expansion
in succession. The idea is to get as many people as possible to join the train and kill the A-Ranks as fast as possible.

The rewards for killing A-Ranks differ depending on the expansion, and not all expansions have trains running.

In the table below, Tomestone A refers to the tomestone that is weekly capped and Tomestone B refers to the tomestone that is uncapped but are not poetics (2nd in currency menu).

The names of these tomestones change from patch to patch. As of writing this in 7.05, Tomestone A is `Heliometry` and Tomestone B is `Aesthetics`

| Expansion | A Rank Reward | Train? |
|----------|----------|----------|
| A Realm Reborn | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Allied Seals, 20 Centurio Seals | No, A-Ranks killed on sight |
| Heavensward | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Centurio Seals | No, A-Ranks killed on sight |
| Stormblood | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Centurio Seals, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/a9133f968bc/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Cluster</a> | Yes, but rarer these days |
| Shadowbringers | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b27acfc4093/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Stellacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/8c5a623a256/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Planicluster</a> | Yes |
| Endwalker | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c21b9948087/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Anthocluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/40d45e3a9c0/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Dendrocluster</a> | Yes |
| Dawntrail/Latest Expansion | 30 Poetics, 10 Tomestone A, 10 Tomestone B, 40 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0612d5f2b45/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Novacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0b7fcd6c50b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Prismaticluster</a> | Yes |

What we're after for here are the latest expansion A-Rank trains. These drop a variant of "Clusters" that can be exchanged for the current tier of materia.

> Note: In case you're reading after Dawntrail, there will always be a new type of cluster introduced that is relevant for that tier! That's the one you want!

Since there are 2 A-Ranks in each zone, this means you'll be raking in 360 poetics, 120 Weekly Tomestones (A), 240 Tomestone B, and 480 sacks of nuts per train.

In addition to that you'll also be getting 2 clusters for each A-Rank killed. One for the highest tier matiera, and one for the 2nd best (right now these are `XI` and `XII`)

Not only that but sometimes there will be multiple instances per zone, so if there was 3 instances of some particular zone, then suddenly there are now 6 A-Ranks on that zone.

> Note: You need to kill full credit to get all rewards. Join a party! Read ["Earning Credit""](https://ffxivhunt.carrd.co/#how-to-earn-credit) for more info.

Don't forget about Cross World and Cross Datacenter travel too! Once the train on your world is over you can keep going by attending trains on other worlds.

The price of materia fluctuates but will usually spike before a raid tier. My advice is to stockpile clusters, wait for a price spike, exchange for whats most valuable, and sell!

**XII Materia Price. The best tier will be different if you're reading post Dawntrail**
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={41772} itemName="Savage Aim Materia XII" itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/20298.png" />

> ## How To Find a Train?
> The best way to find a train is to join a Hunt Discord. There are usually ones for each datacenter (sometimes even World). I would start by looking in [Centurio Hunts](https://discord.com/invite/centuriohunts)
> and then refining down to find a server local to your datacenter or world.
>
> You can also try asking in game during a S-Rank Hunt for a local linkshell invite!

- **Overall:** Excellent method. You can make a ton of gil in a short amount of time. The rewards are consistent and the method is highly repeatable. Just make sure you're in a party!
Its also a fantastic way to cap out on your tomes, and trains are usually abundant thanks to world visit and datacenter travel.

## S-Rank Hunts

S-Rank hunts operate similarly to A-Rank hunts, but they are much rarer and require very specific conditions to be met before they spawn.
As such the rewards are also much higher than A-Ranks.

| Expansion | A Rank Reward |
|----------|----------|
| A Realm Reborn | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone B, 100 Allied Seals, 50 Centurio Seals |
| Heavensward | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone B, 100 Centurio Seals |
| Stormblood | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone B, 100 Centurio Seals, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/a9133f968bc/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Cluster</a> |
| Shadowbringers | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone B, 100 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b27acfc4093/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Stellacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/8c5a623a256/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Planicluster</a> |
| Endwalker | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone B, 100 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c21b9948087/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Anthocluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/40d45e3a9c0/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Dendrocluster</a> |
| Dawntrail/Latest Expansion | 100 Poetics, 30 Tomestone A, 80 Tomestone B, 100 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0612d5f2b45/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Novacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0b7fcd6c50b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Prismaticluster</a> |

Since they are so rare, you'll want to use a tracker to see when they've spawned. The commonly used tool for this is [Faloop](https://faloop.app/).
- You can also try asking for a Hunt Linkshell invite during an S-Rank Hunt or after an A-Rank train

Its good etiquette to arrive and wait for the "pull time" (PT) set by the spawner before attacking. This will be denoted usually in Eorzea Time.

### SS-Rank Hunts
After defeating an S-Rank there is a random chance for a SS-Rank to spawn in the same zone as well. Although its only available in certain expansions

| Expansion | A Rank Reward |
|----------|----------|
| Shadowbringers | 200 Poetics, 50 Tomestone B, 400 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/b27acfc4093/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Stellacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/8c5a623a256/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Planicluster</a> |
| Endwalker | 200 Poetics, 50 Tomestone B, 400 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/c21b9948087/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Anthocluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/40d45e3a9c0/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Dendrocluster</a> |
| Dawntrail/Latest Expansion | 200 Poetics, 50 Tomestone A, 100 Tomestone B, 400 Sacks of Nuts, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0612d5f2b45/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Novacluster</a>, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0b7fcd6c50b/" class="eorzeadb_link">Cracked Prismaticluster</a> |

Players need to kill 4 Minions that spawn around the map within a certain time limit to spawn the SS-Rank. If you see a notification on screen and  people shouting `Minions!` then that means an SS-Rank can be spawned.

- **Overall:** If you're doing stuff on the marketboard, organizing your inventory, basically not running any content. Its a good idea to keep Faloop open
in case S-Ranks spawn. The rewards are pretty good and its a nice way to make some gil on the side. Remember you can also World Visit too!

# Time Sensitive/Seasonal Things
These are a few things that are worth doing but are only available during certain periods of times. It doesn't necessarily mean they
can only be done during those times, but the gil you can make will be higher.

## Secondary Tomestone Materials
- At the beginning of a new Raid tier

Trade your "secondary tomestones" in for materials. The names of these vary from patch to patch, but I'm referring to the tomestones that doesn't
have a weekly cap and isn't Poetics.

![Tomestone Menu](https://files.catbox.moe/7neqkx.png)

As of writing this, the current "secondary tomestone" is `Tomestone of Aesthetics`.

You'll have to find where the NPC that exchanges these is located, right now in Dawntrail the NPC is in Solution Nine.

![Current Aesthetics Tomestone Materials Shop Menu](https://files.catbox.moe/84395m.png)

During the beginning of a new savage raid tier, people will be looking to purchase these materials to make the best 
craftable gear. This would be a good time to farm these materials and sell them on the marketboard.

However, the prices of these materials will drop as time goes on so its not always worth it to farm these.

I'd say they usually go for around 2000 gil each but of course this wildly varies depending on the time of the patch.

- **Overall:** Good gil but only during certain periods when craftable raid gear is needed. Still good to dump these tomes
using this method if you don't need it for anything else.

## Moogle Treasure Trove
These events usually run before a new expansion or patch. During these events you can snag Moogle Tomestones which can be exchanged for
a variety of emotes, orchestrion rolls, minions, mounts, and hairstyles.

You'll need to check which ones are worth the most gil and plan accordingly!

Recently they've started adding Treasure Maps to the vendor. These maps are special as they will ALWAYS spawn a portal dungeon. This might
be worth investing in if you're looking to do some maps.

## Fall Guys Event
Not sure if this will make a return in the future but they have brought it back once already.

The Fall Guys event gives MGP as well as the event currency MGF for each round you play/win. You can actually exchange MGF for rare dyes, so if you're
working towards the "Queen Bean" title then this is a good way to cash in on all that MGF.

# Honourable Mentions
These are small things that you can do to make some gil. They're short and simple so they don't really need a whole section devoted to them.

## Retainer Ventures
- Send your retainers out on `Quick Exploration` ventures
- Sometimes they'll come back with valuable items such as rare dyes that can be sold on the marketboard
- Gear they bring back can be converted into Grand Company Seals

## Island Sanctuary
- Max out your Island Sanctuary rank
- Always have work scheduled in your workshops and granaries
- Once you max out, let the mammets manage the farm and animal, its quite cheap and saves you a ton of time
- Exchange your "Seafarer's Cowries" for rare dyes (highlighted in Green on the vendor menu)

For example the `Gunmetal Black Dye` is worth a pretty penny
<FFXIVItemPrice client:load itemId={30122} itemName="Gunmetal Black Dye " itemImageUrl="https://www.garlandtools.org/files/icons/item/22816.png" />.

These are always worth something because people use it for glamour.

**It's also probably the most passive way to make gil on this list.**

## Treasure Maps
This is probably the most common method of making gil without crafting so I won't go into too much detail.

In general, maps don't yield fantastic raw gil and your mileage will depend on how lucky you get with drops/portals.

Some people suggest soloing old ARR maps for a chance at rare accessories like the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/ca7fc950aec/" class="eorzeadb_link">Spriggan Cap</a>.

However, in my opinion the risk outweighs the reward since for an accessory like this you'll need to either buy the Unhidden Leather Map (usually 200K) or get it as a drop from another ARR map.

Your best bet these days still is to run the latest maps for portals and hope for the best.

There are rare mounts like the [Alkonost](https://ffxivcollect.com/mounts/281) which can be exchanged with items dropped from portal dungeons.

Beyond that you'll mostly be praying to the RNG gods for rare drops...
