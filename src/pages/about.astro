        Hey, I'm Pinapelz. Welcome to my blog where I ramble about random
        things, some technical, some not so technical. I think for the most part
        you'll be able to gauge my interests by looking through the things I've
        written on here in the past.

    <h1>why this?</h1>
    <p>
        I thought it would probably be a good idea to have a place that
        documents some of my thought process since I have this fantastic habit
        of forgetting things, leaving braindead or no comments in my code, and
        generally just writing boilerplate Also it'd be nice to have a place
        where I can sort of archive my thoughts and ideas for future reference.
        <em>(plus I gotta work on my writing skills)</em>
    </p>
    <h1>stuff</h1>
    <p>
        A lot of the things I've experimented with or made are on my GitHub and
        webpage down below. I plan to keep this blog pretty casual though.
